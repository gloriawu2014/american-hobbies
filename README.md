Hobbies give us time to ourselves and are a way to connect with others. 
In a place as diverse as the U.S., people are into all kinds of leisure activities such as watching Netflix, hiking, gaming, crafting, and many more. 
Itâ€™s cool how something as simple as a shared interest can bring people together, or how doing something solo can help us recharge.
          
Hobbies are always an interesting topic of discussion, and people love talking about them -- even reporting them. 
Many reported their hobbies for the 2023 Census. Look at the results.
